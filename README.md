# Database Object File
#This file is an object oriented file written in python which creates a new database with a new sqlite object and contains multiple functions to create and manipulate relational tables within that database.
#This file was written to aid in future projects where database management through sqlite would be needed. This would reduce requirement of using sql script wothin python all the time and make the project comparatively easier.
